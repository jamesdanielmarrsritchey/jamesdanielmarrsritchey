# James Daniel Marrs Ritchey

I develop whatever sparks my interest.

## Projects

My projects are mostly PHP functions, but there's some other stuff as well (HTML, CSS, Javascript, C++, etc).

## Prefixes

Most of my projects following a naming scheme, which involves adding a special prefix. The prefixes are mostly for my benefit, but if you're interested, they're explained below.

### Ritchey (ritchey)

Projects using this prefix are solo projects. Contributions are generally NOT accepted.

### Ritchey & AI (ritcheyandai)

Projects using this prefix are projects I've made largely using AI tools. **They can be thought of as custom examples**, which may aide me in developing future projects. They are not polished works. Use with caution.

### Ritchey & Contributors (ritcheyandcontributors)

Projects using this prefix are open to contributions from other people, but it is still considered a personal project, not a group project.

### Others & Ritchey (othersandritchey)

Projects using this prefix are either projects that I've forked from other people's work, or they are group projects I'm part of.
