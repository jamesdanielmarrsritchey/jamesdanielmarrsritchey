# Introduction

Creator from Canada. Developing whatever sparks my interest.

# Projects

My projects are mostly PHP functions, but there's some other stuff as well.

## Prefixes

Most of my projects following a naming scheme, which involves adding a special prefix. The prefixes are mostly for my benefit, but if you're interested, they're explained below.

### Ritchey (ritchey)

Projects using this prefix are solo projects. Contributions are generally NOT accepted.

### Ritchey & AI (ritcheyandai)

Projects using this prefix are typically projects I've developed largely using AI tools. **For the most part, they are meant as custom examples**, rather than finished polished works, which may aid me when developing further projects.

**Note:** just because a project doesn't use this prefix, doesn't mean it hasn't involved AI use, at some stage.

### Ritchey & Contributors (ritcheyandcontributors)

Projects using this prefix are open to contributions from other people, but it is still considered a personal project, not a group project.

### Others & Ritchey (othersandritchey)

Projects using this prefix are either projects that I've forked from other people's work, or they are group projects I'm part of.
